HUPSORT - Private Social Network for people with Sexually transmitted Diseases.

The web app were built with MeteorJS as Fullstack Framework based on NodeJS. I used MongoDB as NoSQL DB and Blaze as Template management system.

The features are:

* Create an Avatar to keep the privacy of the users. Made with Blaze, HTML5 (Canavas), CSS, obviosly JS.
* Public Chat for all the users registered. The users can chat, upload photos, emojis and tag other users (with @).
* Each user has a profile page where they can upload photos, status and other users can put comments on their profiles.
* I've used Amazon S3 to upload the photos and other static files.
* Also, I've built an android app with Meteor Mobile feature (based on phonegap), but it is in other repository on my github profile :)

I'm going to push more updated to the social network. Thanks,
